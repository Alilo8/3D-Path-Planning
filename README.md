## Algorithms:

1. **A\* Algorithm:**
   - A popular pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency and optimality.

2. **RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree) Algorithm:**
   - A randomized algorithm suitable for non-holonomic systems.

3. **RBT (New) Algorithm:**
   - Introducing a new algorithm for 3D path planning.

Feel free to interact with the simulation and observe the behaviors of these algorithms in the context of 3D path planning.
